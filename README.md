# STM32-IIR-Filter



I Implemented a first order IIR filter with STM32 to filter the speed of a DC motor.

I used Matlab to discretize the transfer function of a low pass filter and STM32CubeMonitor to display the data.
The orange line is the raw unfiltered signal.
The blue line is the filtered signal.
